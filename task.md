Front-end development:
Requirements:
• Develop the user authentication module using either the React or Vue framework.
• Design elements are open to your creativity.
• You must use TypeScript.

database.
• Add at least one protected endpoint
• Add a readme file with basic information on how to work with the repo.
• You can choose the appropriate ORM and other libraries if needed.
Notes:
Build API endpoints to sign up and sign in users to the application, taking in
the account requirements to the fields described in the Front-end part.
Nice to haves:
• Implementing logging on the back end
• Following best practices for security
• Api documentation
Submission:
Once completed, create a public GitHub repository and push your code to it.
Share the repository link with the recruiter.
